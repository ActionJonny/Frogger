## Frogger Items To Do
* ~~Create a canvas.~~
* Autofocus canvas or a StartGame screen on click.
* ~~Frog object with functions for moving LRUD.~~
* ~~EventListeners for frog.~~
* ~~Animation so canvas is always redrawing.~~
* ~~Obstacles to avoid.~~
* ~~Obstacles moving across canvas in alternating lanes.~~
* Refactor obstacle and frog sizing.
* Obstacles of same direction pushed in to arrays to DRY and make collision detection function readable.

* Ability to pause and resume animations or add text/btn to screen when level is complete.
